== Contributing Guide

WARNING: This is a work-in-progress document.

This document describes how to contribute to Rhythm Cafe. Contributing to an open
source project can be a daunting task. It is my hope that this will make the process
easier.

If you are new to this, I recommend using the CodeSandbox based approach which is 
described below. The CodeSandbox based approach allows you to run
the app and make edits without installing anything on your computer.

TIP: This document is formatted in Asciidoc. The easiest way to read it is in the GitHub
preview. If you see a little lightbulb to the left of this, you're reading it in GitHub!

== You will need:

 - **A GitHub account**. This is required to open pull requests, and at the time of writing CodeSandbox requires GitHub for sandboxes.

== CodeSandbox Installation

|You may be prompted to sign in. Sign in with your GitHub account, if you have one.
If you don't have one yet, that's fine too; you can sign in with Google and these instructions will still work.

If you already have an account, this step does not apply.

|CodeSandbox will whirr away for a bit, and then you will see the Rhythm Cafe page again. Note that the top
bar now displays a different project name.

|*Optional*: The default view is quite cramped, in my opinion. Click the "Open in New Window" button in the Browser panel
to open the browser in its own window.

|Make file edits as you please. When you edit, changes are automatically reflected in the browser window.

There are a lot of files. For guidance for how to find the thing you want to edit, please look at the below section (WIP)
