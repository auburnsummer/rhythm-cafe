== Contributing Guide

WARNING: This is a work-in-progress document.

This document describes how to contribute to Rhythm Cafe. Contributing to an open
source project can be a daunting task. It is my hope that this will make the process
easier.

If you are new to this, I recommend using the CodeSandbox based approach which is 
described below. The CodeSandbox based approach allows you to run
the app and make edits without installing anything on your computer.

TIP: This document is formatted in Asciidoc. The easiest way to read it is in the GitHub
preview. If you see a little lightbulb to the left of this, you're reading it in GitHub!

== You will need:

 - **A GitHub account**. This is required to open pull requests, and at the time of writing CodeSandbox requires GitHub for sandboxes.

== CodeSandbox Installation

|CodeSandbox will whirr away for a bit, and then you will see the Rhythm Cafe page again. Note that the top
bar now displays a different project name.

|*Optional*: The default view is quite cramped, in my opinion. Click the "Open in New Window" button in the Browser panel
to open the browser in its own window.

|*Optional*: After opening the browser in its own window, you can click on the "Toggle Preview" button to collapse the right panel.

TIP: if you are a light theme user like me, you can adjust the colour theme at File -> Preferences -> Color Theme
